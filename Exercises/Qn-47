Node Affinity

Q 47. In the Kubernetes namespace prod, create a Pod named imp-pod that runs the image nginx:1.26.0.

Configure node affinity so that the pod prefers to be scheduled on a node with the label az=zone1, assigning it a weight of 80.

Additionally, make the pod also prefer a node labeled az=zone2 with a weight of 20.
