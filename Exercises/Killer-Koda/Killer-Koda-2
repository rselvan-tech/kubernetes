Scheduling Pod Anti Affinity
Select Node by Pod Anti Affinity
There is a Pod YAML provided at /root/hobby.yaml .

That Pod should be required to be only scheduled on Nodes where no Pods with label level=restricted are running.

For the topologyKey use kubernetes.io/hostname .

There are no taints on any Nodes which means no tolerations are needed.

SOLUTION :-
===========

controlplane:~$ cat hobby.yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    level: hobby
  name: hobby-project
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx:alpine
    name: c
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
       - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: level
              operator: In
              values:
              - restricted
         topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname 
controlplane:~$ 


Further Analysis :-
=================
For this first create this additional Pod:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    level: restricted
  name: restricted-2
spec:
  nodeName: controlplane
  containers:
  - image: nginx:alpine
    name: c
Once done, we should see all three Pods running:

kubectl get pod -owide --show-labels
This is because the used requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: is, as the name says, only considered during scheduling and not for running Pods.


Now we delete and recreate the Pod from the previous step:

kubectl -f /root/hobby.yaml delete --force --grace-period 0

kubectl -f /root/hobby.yaml apply
Now we should see that the Pod is not being scheduled and remains in Pending, because no Nodes are available.

There are logs about scheduling if we describe:

kubectl get pod -owide --show-labels

kubectl describe pod hobby-project
