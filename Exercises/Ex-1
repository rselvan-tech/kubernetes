Pod Admission Controls

Q 46. In the kube-prod namespace, configure pod admission controls to enforce default resource requests and limits for containers.

The following conditions must be met:

In the absence of specified CPU or memory requests and limits, a container should be assigned default values of 200m CPU and 100Mi memory for requests, and 400m CPU and 200Mi memory for limits.

Prevent any container in this namespace from requesting more than 500Mi of memory.
